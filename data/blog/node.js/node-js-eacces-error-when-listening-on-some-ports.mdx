Today, I was working on one of my projects(a Next.js site) and got the following error when I tried to start the program:

```
 тип Failed to start server
Error: listen EACCES: permission denied 0.0.0.0:3000
    at <unknown> (Error: listen EACCES: permission denied 0.0.0.0:3000)
    at new Promise (<anonymous>) {
  code: 'EACCES',
  errno: -4092,
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000
}
```

I was originally thinking that the port was already in use, so I checked if it was and then found that it wasn't.

After some research, I figured out how to fix it.

## Solution

Note: The solution is from a [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9166332/22344092).

### Running locally (Mac OS, Linux)
As a general rule, processes running without root privileges cannot bind to ports below 1024.

So try a higher port, or run with elevated privileges via `sudo`.  You can downgrade privileges after you have bound to the low port using [`process.setgid`](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_setgid_id) and [`process.setuid`](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_setuid_id).

### Running locally (Windows)

It's possible another process is already listening on this port, or the ports have been added to an excluded range.

To show excluded ranges
```
> netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp
```

To remedy, either choose another port, or you can try to release the ranges by restarting the `winnat` service.

Run `cmd` with admin rights.

```

> net stop winnat
> net start winnat

```

### Running on PaaS (eg: heroku)

When running your apps on most platform as a service offerings, you have to use the port as specified in the PORT environment variable.

See http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js for an example

```javascript
const server = require('http').createServer();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

server.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on ${port}`));
```
