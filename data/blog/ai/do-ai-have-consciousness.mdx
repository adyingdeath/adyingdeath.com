I've seen many people discussing whether AI have consciousness, or if they will have consciousness in the future. Some thought that AI don't have consciousness. Do AI have consciousness? It's hard to say. Actually, we don't even define what is consciousness before we try to answer this question.

The LLM is a recent turning point in AI research. Turing test was proposed by Turing in 1950, which is considered as a promising way to determine whether a system has consciousness. If people can't distinguish a machine from a human, then it's considered with consciousness. **However, LLMs today are far from passing the Turing test.** So, is it time to say that LLMs have consciousness? I don't know.

Consciousness is a complex concept, which is really hard to do research on. Actually, we can't even confirm whether a human except us have consciousness.
