title: How to Enable IntelliSense for Unity Projects in VS Code

Though Unity uses Visual Studio as its default IDE, I still prefer VS Code. It's my everyday editor for programming. But there wasn't any IntelliSense from the first day I started using it with my Unity project, and I had been writing code without IntelliSense for quite some time. I can write code, though, but it's not comfortable. I even need to search on Google for some basic attributes of GameObject or so.

Today, after some searching, I've figured out how to bring IntelliSense for Unity projects into VS Code, so you can write code just like in Visual Studio.

## Prepare the Plugins

You should first install these plugins:

### C#

### C# Dev Kit

### Unity

## Configure Unity

After installing the plugins, we're halfway there.

Firstly, open one of your Unity projects, find `Edit > Preferences > External Tools`. Then, you can find an option called `External Script Editor`, exactly the first option on my Unity. Click the dropdown. Click `Browse...`. Go to the path where your VS Code is installed and select the VS Code executable file.

Secondly, uncheck all the options in the section named `Generate .csproj files for:`, just like the image below. Then, click the `Regenerate project files` button. You will find some new files generated in the project folder, like `.sln`, `.csproj`, etc.

Finally, close VS Code and reopen it. Or open the Command Palette (the shortcut is `Ctrl + Shift + P` on my VS Code) and run `Developer: Reload Window`. Wait patiently until all the resources complete loading. Now, you can try writing code to see if there is IntelliSense.
