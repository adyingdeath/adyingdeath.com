Recently, I needed to extract a very large zip file and ran into an issue where 7-zip was using a temp folder on my C: drive (where space was limited and insufficient).

So, I started looking for a solution.

At first, I found a setting in 7-zip to change the temp folder location to a different drive, but it wasn't working. It was still extracting and then copying the files from the temp folder on the C: drive.

Here is the solution from a Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fyahjo/comment/kgoqr82/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

The solution originally came from [this post](https://superuser.com/posts/717198/revisions).

I'm recording this tip here for future reference.
