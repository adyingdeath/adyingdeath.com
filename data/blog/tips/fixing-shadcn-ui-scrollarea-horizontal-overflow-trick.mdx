I encountered an annoying issue where the shadcn/ui ScrollArea component wasn't containing overflow properly. Instead of scrolling horizontally, the content would overflow and push the entire page wide.

## The Problem

I had a ScrollArea wrapping a code block in my blog:

```tsx
<ScrollArea className="w-full">
  <code>{/* some long code line */}</code>
</ScrollArea>
```

On narrow screens, instead of the code block scrolling within the ScrollArea, it would stretch the entire page wide and cause horizontal scrolling on the document body.

## The Trick

Here's the fix by [CeamKrier](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4865314/ceamkrier) from stackoverflow - set both `flex-1` and a small random width (e.g., `w-1`) on the ScrollArea:

```tsx
<ScrollArea className="w-1 flex-1">
  <code>{/* your content */}</code>
</ScrollArea>
```

That's it. The ScrollArea now properly contains overflow and shows a horizontal scrollbar instead of stretching the page.

## Why This Works

Honestly, it seems counterintuitive - why would setting `w-1` and `flex-1` together make it work? The StackOverflow community also found this surprising, but it works reliably across different projects.
